=== JoeSnellPdx - BASE Theme ===

This theme began as a fusion of Twitter Bootstrap and _s Wordpress Theme by Automattic.

The CSS is compiled using SASS (more information can be found in styles.css).

Feel free to use as you wish, fork on github, let me know of issues, whatever.  If you like what I've done, please give me a shout on twitter @joesnellpdx, on my site www.joesnellpdx.com, on LinkedIn (http://www.linkedin.com/in/joesnellpdx), or, hey why not all three!

Below is some information I kept here because it relates to some of the files/settings in the _s Theme.

* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* A sample custom header implementation in inc/custom-header.php that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found the comments of inc/custom-header.php to your header.php template.
* Custom template tags in inc/template-tags that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Sample theme options in /inc/theme-options/ that can can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php.
* Some small tweaks in /inc/tweaks.php that can improve your theming experience. They can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php.
* Keyboard navigation for image attachment templates. The script can be found in js/keyboard-navigation.js. It’s enqueued in functions.php.
* A script at js/small-menu.js that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It’s enqueued in functions.php.
* 5 sample CSS layouts in /layouts: Two sidebars on the left, two sidebars on the right, a sidebar on either side of your content, and two-column layouts with sidebars on either side.
* Smartly organized starter CSS in style.css that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
* The GPL license in license.txt. :) Use it to make something cool.

I will using this theme as a foundation to fork individual projects.  Stay tuned!
